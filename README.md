Lab6: Demo on ControlsFX push notifications and ScheduledExecutorService

A starter code to a reminder app that allows the user to be reminded 15min, one hour, or one day before a particular event.

***Note:*** ControlsFx not supported by default in JavaFx, therefore you need to downlaod the .jar file and add it to libraries.
